# Python-CSV-Database-Manipulation-Scripts
Within this repository you will find a couple database scripts written in Python that I made as some further work for a databases module.

Both of these scripts can serve as examples of how to use each database's respective python module. For my work I had CSV files which I took data from in a given square area and then transformed the data to be accepted into the MySQL or MongoDB database. Feel free to use these files to help understand automating data transfer from CSV files to databases.
